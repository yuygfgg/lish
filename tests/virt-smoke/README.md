# virt-smoke — modern-system boot harness

Boots the **virt** machine (`crates/rv64-system/src/virt.rs`, runner
`bin/rv64-vboot`) — a riscv64 Linux kernel whose
boot-critical virtio paths are built in — and
runs a tiny initramfs whose `init` (`init.c`) drives the full-system paths that
were once broken. On success it prints `SMOKE_OK` and powers off; a hang makes
the harness time out and fail.

```
web/prepare-images.sh
tests/virt-smoke/run.sh
```

The default kernel is a versioned Lish image. The freestanding init is built by
the compiler selected by `RISCV_PREFIX` or the local Zig toolchain. The custom
linker script keeps code and read-only data in one executable segment because
Linux applies page permissions at `PT_LOAD` granularity.

## What it exercises, and why it's layered

We found three real full-system bugs bringing this up (all now fixed). They are
**not equally catchable by an integration test**, which is the crux of the test
design:

| Bug | Symptom | Guarded by | Why |
|-----|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Missing 8250 THRE (TX) interrupt** | Guest wedges at `default_idle_call`; bash's tty drain-`ioctl` blocks forever | **this smoke test** (deterministic) | The interrupt-driven-TX / drain path fires on *any* real console workload, so a small test still trips it reliably. |
| **LR/SC reservation not cleared on trap** | Lost atomic update → intermittent lost wakeup | **unit test** `cpu::tests::trap_invalidates_lr_reservation` | Needs an interrupt to land in the exact LR→SC window of a *contended* atomic — rare on one hart. A simple boot passes even with the bug reverted, so an integration test is worthless here; a direct unit test is deterministic. |
| **`rdtime` frozen within a slice** | Busy-wait loops (`__delay`) stall; short-interval timing reads 0 | **unit test** `cpu::tests::rdtime_derives_live_from_insn_count` | A correctness property of the `time` CSR, not a boot-visible hang. |

**Lesson (verified empirically):** simplifying an integration test does *not*
automatically preserve its bug-catching power. We validated each guard by
reverting its fix and confirming the guard fails:

- THRE reverted → this harness times out with no `SMOKE_OK`. ✓
- LR/SC reservation reverted → this harness still passes (bug is probabilistic),
  but the unit test fails. ✓ → that's why the reservation and rdtime invariants
  live in fast, deterministic `cargo test -p rv64-core` unit tests, and the
  integration test only claims to guard the THRE hang and direct Linux boot.

So the regression coverage is **layered**: unit tests pin the subtle CPU-core
invariants; this smoke test pins the emergent full-system behavior.

## init.c

Runs as PID 1 in the initramfs and, in order:

1. `rdtime` delta across a `nanosleep` (sanity that the monotonic clock moves).
2. `CLOCK_REALTIME` is a modern Unix epoch, seeded from the goldfish RTC.
3. A large console-output burst + `tcdrain` — forces the 8250
   driver into interrupt-driven TX and blocks on the drain if THRE is missing.
4. A `fork`+`wait` loop with the timer ticking underneath (multi-process /
   atomic churn).
5. `SMOKE_OK`, then `reboot(RB_POWER_OFF)`.

The smoke test uses a small initramfs. The Alpine image test covers a writable
root filesystem and package-manager boot path. Larger guest workloads belong in
separate, explicitly provisioned benchmarks.
