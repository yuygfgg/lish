# stage that ran passed, and in strict mode that every stage was available.

# Stages:
#   1. cargo tests        unit + guest-integration tests
#   2. guest builds       Rust->riscv64gc-musl test binaries
#   3. qemu differential  guests bit-identical on qemu-riscv64
#   4. riscv-tests        official ISA suite, 134 tests (cross-gcc needed)
#   5. spike lockstep     per-instruction register-writeback diff vs Spike
#   6. riscv-arch-test    official architecture tests, signatures vs Spike
#   7. wasm build + smoke + JIT differential fuzzer through Node
#   8. virt-smoke        modern-system (Debian-class) boot regression test
#
# Under the nix dev shell (flake.nix) all tools are present.
