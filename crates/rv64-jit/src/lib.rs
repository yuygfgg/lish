//! RV64 WebAssembly JIT for basic blocks, traces, loops, and code regions.
//!
//! State contract with the host: the guest register file lives in the
//! module's imported linear memory —
//!
//! ```text
//! offset   0..256   x0..x31 (u64 LE)
//! offset 256        pc      (u64 LE)
//! ```
//!
//! A compiled block updates registers in place, stores the next pc, and
//! returns. The dispatcher (interpreter loop) looks up the next block by pc.
//!
//! Unsupported operations return to the interpreter. Compressed instructions
//! use the same expansion path as the interpreter.

// Translation routines receive explicit architectural state and emitter
// operands. Bundling them would obscure the generated-code contract.
